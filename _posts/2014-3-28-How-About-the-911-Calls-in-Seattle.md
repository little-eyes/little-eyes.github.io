Very fortunately I have a chance to look at the `911 call` data in the city of Seattle. The [data.seattle.gov][1] provides developers and scientist a complete access to their public data source. Among my current explore, I find by looking at the 911 call data is a very interesting angel to observe the city. The data I explored is roughly from 2011 till now.

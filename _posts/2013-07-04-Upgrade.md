title: A Linux-less future?

For the past six months I've been using Linux, more precisely [OpenSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org),
as my primary OS. It is awesome. I have this:

I use bash all the time and it is now a prerequisite for all my future computer
purchases. More importantly, bioinformatics programs are, almost exclusively, written for
\*nix systems.

On a separate but related note and seemingly unlike the entirety of the internet, 
I actually use and enjoy Gnome 3.x. I think it is elegant, fast, 
and stable or, at least, moreso than Unity or Cinnamon. I can customize it to my
heart's content and the dark theme is very easy on the eyes.

Finally, I am completely enamored with the repository system. Simply running 

    sudo zypper up
    
to update any and all applications on my computer is a surreal experience for
Windows-defectors like myself. It is a great user experience. Perhaps the 
Gnome developers should develop a more robust front-end (PackageKit
is pitiful) for more novice users, but I am satisfied with how it stands right now.

Now, what might be the problem? 

The problem is that I do not live in a Office-less and Photoshop-less world. I
have come to realize that, despite my best efforts, it is very difficult to
avoid those two 400kg software gorillas. My increased interaction with biochemists
during my current summer research has highlighted the Office-shaped hole in the
Linux application portfolio. Libreoffice is unable to provide the compatibility
and features that I require. [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org), on the other
hand, is superior to Illustrator, but GIMP cannot match the
power and versatility of Photoshop. Also, Linux lacks even the most primitive video editting
application, however there are some murmurings of something coming.

Additionally, I have had a lot of nagging problems with Linux installs on my
Samsung Series 9 15in laptop. This is no fault of Linux, but instead due to 
the abysmal support provided by Samsung. OpenSUSE works the best among 
the distros that I have had time to try, but some annoying bugs persist (i.e.
ACPI is broken so the laptop cannot detect if it is plugged in and it can't
detect when the lid is shut, etc). I am aware of places like System76 that sell
systems that are designed for, and run, Linux, but that does not solve the
outstanding compatibility issue.

Therefore, and despite bad experiences in the past, I have decided that I will
upgrade to the next generation of Macbook Pros with Retina Displays (rMBP) once
they are released. I have not decided whether I will purchase the 13" or the 15",
but I am leaning towards the former for portability, despite the latter's
significant performance advantage. Oh, and that screen...

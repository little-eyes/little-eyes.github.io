My obligations and responsibilities this semester are more than they have ever been during my Uni career. I used to be able to manage everything using a haphazard collection of post-its and my highly unreliable memory. I decided that, since I am teaching for the first time, it was time to jettison my former system and switch to something better.

So I started scouring the Windows Phone Marketplace for a mobile app that might satisfy my needs. I happened across a lightweight, minimalist app known as [Due][1]. It was a paid-only app, but the reviews were very good and it looked like it might fit the bill. $0.99 is a pittance for a good app.

It is probably the best $0.99 that I have ever spent.

Due lets you create a to-do item and make it due today, tomorrow, or someday with an option of assigning the task for a specific day. Its Live Tile shows the number of items that are due on that day. That's all there is to it. It takes the KISS principle to the extreme and eliminates all the kruft and (dubious) features of most of its competition. It is also easy on the eyes:

This is a prime example of applying minimalism to create a more useful product. Kudos to the developers. My only gripe with Due is the lack of an edit button for previously created tasks, but I am sure that is coming. A smaller text size for the to-do items might be nice as well.

All in all, Due is an excellent app for getting my life organized.

#About

Hi, I'm **Tamas Nagy**.

<img align="left" class="profile" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/{{ site.author.gravatar }}?s=128" alt="Tamas' profile">

I am a Biochemistry and Applied Mathematics student at the University of Kentucky. I enjoy writing words and [code]({{ site.author.github }}). I [research](/research/). I have a passion for [photography]({{ site.author.500px }}). I'm an open-source and [cryptography](/encryption/) enthusiast.

I can be found on [Twitter]({{ site.author.twitter }}) and by [email](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).

##Meta

This blog is powered by open source technology, including:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io)
- [Bigfoot JS](http://www.bigfootjs.com/)
- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)

Without these wonderful projects, it would be just a shell of its current form. It's hosted by the kind folks over at [Github](http://github.com). I have a propensity to tinker and this blog is my unfortunate lab rat. I occasionally blog about my experiences with these modifications under the [#meta](/tags/#meta) tag. The source for each page is easily accessible via the source button in the bottom navbar.

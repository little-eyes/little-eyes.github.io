> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. (Matthew 24:35)

I had a pretty good hike today during which I learned so much from a bunch of new friends. They are freshmen from China who are so passionate about photography, adventure and their new life here. 

Arrived even less than a month, one of the students were talking to me about his high school graduation experience that spent a month traveling in south west part of China which some places I have never heard of. He showed us a lot of good pictures and experience during that trip. I am amazed by those kids' view of the country and world, because they already sense some difference between China and United States. 

They asked me an important question, which reminds me about my freshman year was `eight years ago`. This suddenly triggered a lot of emotions in my mind. I start thinking about my past eight years and have to confess that I wasted most of it, except for finding my beautiful wife. You probably know about the feelings: doubt, hesitance, sad, regret, etc. They are all those words come to my mind.

Why? John Piper's _Don't Waste Your Life_ flashes onto my face. I was looking for a good academic record; I was expecting to get an offer from a University; and I was hunting for a good job. I did all of these -- all clear shots! But why I am not exciting? Simply because all those things are temporary. They will fade away, some times very quickly. When I talk to those students, you have to admit one thing that they will accomplish all those things I mentioned above, again! That's a strong and crucial word: `again`, which means nobody's work will stay in this world permanently.

Come to Christ should be the best thing I could every have during the eight years. I learned why I should grab the eternal thing first and why I should do it as early as possible. We all don't have time to waste our life even you still feel young. This is what I learned from my previous anxiety attack experience. When you have a feeling about you are going to die, you are just weak and helpless. 

-- Short ending.

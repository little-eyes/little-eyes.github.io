		I am a graduate student in University of Tennessee. I think, I research, I code, I analyze data and I love coffee. Most of my project has been published on my <a href="https://github.com/little-eyes">Github</a>. In Jan 2014, I join Microsoft as a Software Development Engineer in Windows Fundamentals/Data Apps team.

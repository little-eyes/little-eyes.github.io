#Research

I am investigating the role of the transmembrane (TM) domain of Hendra virus (HeV) fusion protein in the viral entry process. HeV is an emerging, highly contagious, zoonotic virus in the *Paramyxoviridae* family. The following schematic (from [here](http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_protein/987.html)) gives a high-level overview of *Paramyxoviridae* fusion.

This research hopes to expand our knowledge of the biochemical processes governing lipid fusion and protein-lipid interactions. This information would assist in the production of more robust antivirals.
